## Team work
```
The strong teamwork between our group is what motivated everyone in the group throughout the whole of Project-2. Being supportive of one another and learning from each other was an extremely rewarding part of this project. We could rely on each other and always knew that if we did not understand a particular thing or needed guidance that we were not alone and could depend on each other.

## Models
The application is based on one `passwords_db` database containing two tables namely `user` and `passwords`. See [schema](#screenshots---schema) here.

## Associations
* `Passwords` belongs to a `User`, and a `User` has many `Password` models, as a user can have multiple passwords but a password can only belong to one user.

## Future developments
  1. Add a button on the landing page "forgot my password" which will send a temporary password recovery link to user's email.
  2. App will notify the user that password has not been changed for more than 6 months. 
  3. Automatic notification will be sent to users registered email.
  4. Users inputs will be validated.
  5. Allow user to search a password on the dashboard.
  6. Finding a more secure way to encrypting the database.
  7. Add a reveal icon to display the password.
  8. URL click will direct to the website and auto-fill username and password.
